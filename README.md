# hello-world
this is just a start
because I got a new keyboard which has a key which says |\ besides the left shift
but in reality, it performs the <> thingy. this sucks as the left shift key is small 
in width. but I do love typing on this keyboard because it has full sized arrow
keys which is great when moving around in a code.
